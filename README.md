# Personal Portfolio Website – Modern Developer Portfolio

**Overview**
A sleek, modern personal portfolio website built to showcase my skills, experience, and projects as an aspiring backend developer.  
The site focuses on clean design, smooth interactions, and real-world integrations while maintaining excellent performance and readability.  
It serves as both a personal brand and a practical demonstration of frontend fundamentals and API-driven features.

**Requirements**
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)  
- Active internet connection for EmailJS, GitHub APIs, and Google Fonts  
- No backend server required (fully client-side application)  

**Technologies Used**
- **HTML5** for semantic structure and accessibility  
- **CSS3** with custom variables for a scalable, dark-themed design system  
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity, animations, and logic  
- **EmailJS** for contact form email delivery without a backend  
- **GitHub APIs** for live repositories and contribution data  
- **Intersection Observer API** for scroll-based animations  
- **Web APIs** for smooth scrolling, event handling, and UI state control  

**Key Features**
- Responsive, modern UI with a developer-focused dark theme  
- Smooth scroll navigation with active section highlighting  
- Animated hero section with live stats and call-to-actions  
- Experience timeline and skills overview  
- Project showcase with direct GitHub links  
- Live GitHub repositories and contribution visualization  
- Contact form with EmailJS integration and toast notifications  
- Intersection-based reveal animations for sections  
- Lightweight, dependency-minimal architecture  

**Application Flow**
- Visitor lands on the hero section with a clear introduction  
- Smooth navigation between About, Experience, Projects, and Contact  
- Scroll-based animations reveal content progressively  
- Users can explore projects and GitHub activity  
- Contact form sends messages directly via EmailJS with instant feedback  

**Purpose**
- To present my developer profile in a clean, professional, and engaging way  
- To demonstrate real-world frontend patterns like API usage, animations, and UI feedback  
- To act as a central hub for recruiters, collaborators, and peers  

**Notes**
- All logic runs on the client side  
- EmailJS handles email delivery securely without exposing backend code  
- GitHub data is fetched live and may be rate-limited by GitHub APIs  
- Built with performance, clarity, and scalability in mind  

**Possible Enhancements**
- Add backend support for form handling and analytics  
- Introduce a blog or writing section  
- Implement theme toggling (dark/light mode)  
- Improve SEO and performance optimizations  
- Add unit tests for critical UI logic
